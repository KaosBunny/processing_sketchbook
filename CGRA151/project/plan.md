# Vision
## Game Concept
A pixel chess game where the player is playing against a computer. The game will
follow the standard rules of chess pitting the player against a redamentary chess
AI. The game will be made out of pixel art and will have a menu at the beginning
that allows the player to enable/disable a timer and select their colour.

## Gameplay
The game will, as said previously, follow the standard rules of chess. The player
will control the game through the mouse. Clicking on a chess piece will give you 
an overlay of the board showing your possible move locations. Clicking one of these
locations will move the piece to that location and then the computer will take it's 
turn. Repeat until forfit or checkmate. The player will be able to enable a chess
timer that will allow them to test themselves on speed.

## Visual Design
The game will be made out of simple pixel art. colours will be that of a wooden chess
board with the normal white and black pieces. Visual interactions should ideally be shown 
entirely through subtle prompts, but there will be menues (also pixel art) and tool
tips for smaller/less obvious things.
